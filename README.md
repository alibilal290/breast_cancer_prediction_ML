# breast_cancer_prediction_ML

## The four tasks are summarised below:

**1. Pre-process the dataset and perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the data:**
This should include:
• Splitting the dataset into a Training Set and a Test Set;
• Taking care of any missing, duplicated or outlier values;
• Transforming data, where appropriate to do so;
• Encoding categorical features;
• Performing feature engineering techniques such as feature extraction and selection;
• Producing appropriate and informative plots and tables for an exploratory analysis;
• Assessing statistical assumptions and inferences.
     
**2. Utilising features and attributes derived from the pre-processing and EDA stage, conduct an unsupervised machine learning analysis with the aim of gaining further insights into the data via either clustering or dimensionality reduction.**
To do this, you may consider:
• Clustering using different appropriate algorithms, e.g. K-means, hierarchical, DBScan;
• Performing a dimensionality reduction to see if this improves your clustering, or to see if a smaller number of features can adequately explain the observations;
• Evaluating the utility of the different algorithms with appropriate metrics.

**3. Utilising features and attributes from your pre-processing, EDA and unsupervised work, conduct a supervised machine learning analysis aimed at either classifying cases of breast cancer as benign (diagnosis=B) or malignant (Diagnosis=M), or predicting one of the numerical features using regression techniques.**
To do this, you may think of:
• Utilising different classification algorithms to correctly identify observations as benign (Diagnosis=B) or malignant (Diagnosis=M);
• Creating some regression models to predict the numerical features;
• Evaluating your supervised models with metrics of your choice.

**4. Provide well written paragraphs, annotations, tables and plots in your Jupyter Notebooks explaining in detail the workflow, the results and the reasons for the choices you have made**
• At the end of each part of the analysis, summarise and reflect on the task at hand. Use the opportunity to present and support your decisions with informative tables, graphs, and explanations;
• Outline the structure of the report in a logical and flowing fashion, as you might expect of a workflow in the context of a professional presentation or academic publication;
• Conclude your notebook with a final conclusions, evaluations and recommendations section, drawing all of the analysis together and highlighting any limitations of the work done;
• Discuss briefly any ethical implications you can think of arising from this kind of work.
